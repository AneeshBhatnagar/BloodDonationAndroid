# Blood Donation Android Application
#### Built by Aneesh Bhatnagar
Developed as an undergraduate major project, the Android App communicates with a REST API built in PHP to provide the data to a user. 
It allows you to register for the service, log in and request certain types of blood groups. 
It was tested on a small group of people with different Android devices and it proved helpful.
